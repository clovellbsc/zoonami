##Zoonami

A top down rpg style game where you find the zoonami and do battle with a little help from good old charmander.

A very basic game at the moment.

- clone the repo
- Type the following into your terminal to install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

- Ensure you are using VSCode and have vscode live server installed.

- To run the project start the vscode live server whilst in the project root folder and it should open a tab with the game running
